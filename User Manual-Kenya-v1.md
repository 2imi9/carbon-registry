The Integrated Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (iMRV) Tool aims to assist the Climate

Change Division and other line ministries/departments to develop a concise and strategic

domestic/national MRV system. It is envisaged that the iMRV tool would assist in enhancing

monitoring, tracking, reporting and verifying of climate actions including national GHG

emissions, climate change mitigation action, adaptation actions, climate finance and

policies.

This is expected to assist in leveraging international, regional and domestic public and private

climate finance flows. The integrated MRV Tool will be robust but built upon available

resources e.g., data, human resources, capacity etc. and existing systems of monitoring and

reporting (data collection and analysis) with minimal additional burden to the reporting agency

and relevant stakeholders.

The iMRV Tool has been developed was finalized during the extensive multiple stakeholder

consultation process, however this is a living tool and further improved over the period. Hence

some of the features/requirements are kept for future development and implementation. The

present version of integrated MRV Tool covers following key elements:

•

•

National GHG Inventory (limited to key sector and sub-sectors)

Monitoring and Tracking: Climate Change Mitigation Actions/Projects and GHG

emission reductions

•

•

•

Monitoring and Tracking: Climate Change Adaption Actions/Projects and Impacts.

Monitoring and Tracking: Climate Finance Flow towards Climate Actions.

Monitoring and Tracking: SDG impact of climate actions.

The iMRV Tool design approach was to transparently demonstrate progress made towards

the targets defined in the national policies and frameworks such as Climate Change Action

Plan (CCAP), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) etc. Besides measuring ex-post

emissions baseline and mitigation actions, the national MRV system also aimed to track the

progress of implementation in terms of other impacts (e.g., policies, co-benefits, achieving

SDGs), plus results of means of implementation (e.g., tracking of climate finance flows,

technology transfer, capacity building).

**8. SDG Assessment Module**

SDG assessment module has been developed and integrated with this tool to help a broad

range of stakeholders in managing the design, development, implementation, financing,

measurement, reporting and verification of the various type of actions. This will enable the

stakeholders to identify significant impacts, define indicators, quantify impacts and set targets

and track the progress of the actions towards the NDCs.

For consistency with internationally accepted definitions, the terminologies used in this tool

were aligned with the definitions of the Initiative for Climate Action and Transparency (ICAT):

<http://www.climateactiontransparency.org/about/>[ ](http://www.climateactiontransparency.org/about/). This tool is based on UNDP CAIT tool

https://climateimpact.undp.org/ and uses a bottom-up tool that can be applied to track

'significant, direct impacts' of actions. For more information or clarification on SDGs, please

refer the UNDP website: [https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html)

[development-goals.html](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html)

The tool focuses on consolidating the direct impacts resulting from a proposed action. The

tool provides the flexibility to the user to define what impact can be considered significant and

direct – and is an outcome (short-term or long term, intended or unintended) of the proposed

action. The 5 principles below provide the users with a basis for decision making.

**Principle**

**Description**

**Relevance**

Ensure the assessment appropriately reflects the sustainable development impacts

of the policy or action and serves the decision-making needs of users and

stakeholders, both internal and external to the reporting entity. Applying the

principle of relevance depends on the objectives of the assessment, broader policy

objectives, national circumstances, and stakeholder priorities.

**Completeness** Include all significant impacts in the assessment boundary. Disclose and justify

any specific exclusions.

**Consistency** Use consistent accounting approaches, data collection methods, and calculation

methods to allow for meaningful performance tracking over time. Transparently

document any changes to the data, assessment boundary, methods, or any other

relevant factors in the time series.

**Transparency** Provide clear and complete information for internal and external reviewers to

assess the credibility and reliability of the results. Disclose all relevant methods,

data sources, calculations, assumptions, and uncertainties. The information should

be sufficient to enable a party external to the assessment process to derive the

same results if provided with the same source data.

**Accuracy**

Ensure that the estimated impacts are systematically neither over nor under actual

values as far as can be judged and that uncertainties are reduced as far as

practicable. Achieve decisions with reasonable confidence as to the integrity of

the reported information. Accuracy should be pursued as far as possible, but once

uncertainty can no longer be practically reduced, conservative estimates should be

used.

37





**Kenya’s Integrated Measurement Reporting and Verification (MRV) Tool**

**Draft User Manual Version 1.0**

Moreover, the tool provides an assessment criterion to decide whether the impact is significant

enough to warrant additional information. The significance is based on the following criteria:

•

•

Define the likelihood that an impact will occur; and

The expected magnitude of each impact.

For likelihood, the tool uses a 5-point scale as below:

**Likelihood**

**Description**

**Very likely** Reason to believe the effect will happen (or did happen) as a result of the action.

(For example, a probability in the range of 90-100%.)

**Likely**

Reason to believe the effect will probably happen (or probably happened) as a result

of the action. (For example, a probability in the range of 66-90%.)

**Possible**

Reason to believe the effect may or may not happen (or may or may not have

happened) as a result of the action. About as likely as not. (For example, a

probability in the range of 33-66%.)

**Unlikely**

Reason to believe the effect will probably not happen (or probably did not happen)

as a result of the action. (For example, a probability in the range of 10-33%.)

**Very**

**unlikely**

Reason to believe the effect will not happen (or did not happen) as a result of the

action. (For example, a probability in the range of 0-10%.)

For magnitude, the tool uses a 3-point scale as below:

**Magnitude**

**Major**

**Description**

The change in the impact category is likely to be significant in size (either positive or

negative).

**Moderate** The change in the impact category could be significant in size (either positive or

negative).

**Minor**

The change in the impact category is expected to be insignificant in size (either

positive or negative).

Based on the above consideration, the tool then determines whether the impact is significant

and will then require the user to provide additional information in the form of a quantitative

data (e.g. quantitative targets a basis to track the progress of the implementation of the action

through an MRV system).
